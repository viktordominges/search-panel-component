# search-panel-component

Explanation:
Imports: The code begins by importing the Component class from React and the necessary CSS styles for the component.

SearchPanel Class Component: This class component handles the search functionality, allowing users to search for employees.

Constructor and State Initialization: The constructor initializes the component state with a searchWord field set to an empty string.

onUpdateSearchPanel Handler: This method handles updates to the search input:

It captures the current input value.
Updates the component state with the new search word.
Calls the onUpdateSearch prop function passed from the parent component, ensuring the search term is passed up the component hierarchy.
Render Method:

The method returns JSX for rendering the search input field with appropriate class names and handlers.
The input field is of type text, styled with the form-control search-input class.
The placeholder text guides users on the input's purpose.
The input value is bound to the component state, ensuring it reflects the current search word.
The onChange event triggers the onUpdateSearchPanel handler, updating the state and invoking the parent component's search update method.
Export: The component is exported as the default export, making it available for import in other files.
